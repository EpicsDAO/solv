ELSOUL LABO B.V. (Headquarters: Amsterdam, Netherlands, CEO: Fumitake Kawasaki), together with Epics DAO, which it established to operate a Web3 NFT card game supporting open-source software development, is driving innovation and sustainable development in blockchain technology through the development and operation of 'solv', an open-source tool for Solana blockchain validators. This tool has proven its performance and reliability over approximately one year of operation and is now extensively used by many users on both the mainnet and testnet of the Solana blockchain.

We are pleased to announce the release of the new version, solv v4.

The v4 update has added numerous beneficial new features, including launch settings for Relayers that maximize Jito MEV rewards and contribute to the decentralization of the network, as well as support for no-downtime migration of validator nodes.

## About the solv v4 Update

The solv v4 update includes the following new features:

- **Launch Settings for Relayers Maximizing Jito MEV Rewards:** Added launch settings for Relayers that not only maximize Jito MEV rewards but also contribute to the decentralization of the network.
- **No-Downtime Migration for Validator Nodes:** Introduced new commands to support no-downtime migration of validator nodes.
- **Setup Support for Jito RPC:** Added support for setting up Jito RPC.
- **Further Automation of Setup on Google Cloud:** Enhanced automation of necessary settings when operating Solana validators on Google Cloud.
- **Addition of Convenient Commands:** Added new commands to make validator operation more convenient.

In particular, the launch settings for Relayers that maximize Jito MEV rewards and contribute to network decentralization were often avoided due to the complexity and advanced level of the documentation. With solv v4, this feature has been simplified to facilitate easier setup.

The downtime requirements for validator nodes are crucial for maintaining the stability of the Solana network. solv v4 introduces new commands that support no-downtime migration, which is essential for maintaining a high validator score and reliability, thus contributing to the network's stability. This feature is also effective for moving validator nodes strategically or in emergencies, allowing for migration without downtime and stabilizing the operation of validators.

For more details, please see the release notes.

## ELSOUL LABO and Epics DAO

ELSOUL LABO and Epics DAO's core teams are actively involved in open-source software development.

They operate two open-source software projects, "solv" and "Skeet."

"solv" is an open-source tool simplifying the setup and operation of Solana validators and RPC nodes. To earn rewards as a blockchain validator, machine resources of proper specifications are needed, and validator software installation and setup should be completed per documentation, followed by several updates each week.

With "solv," Solana validators can be easily launched with just three commands. Updates require only one command, utilizing the open-source nature so that a single person worldwide can manage the update, and others can download it. solv documentation: https://solv.epics.dev/

![Skeet](/news/2024/03/12/SkeetV2EN.jpg)

"Skeet" is an open-source, serverless app development tool using TypeScript, offering a modern application framework for infrastructure management, rapid app development, AI support, and dApp/Web3 development.

Skeet documentation: https://skeet.dev/

The Skeet development team's paper, "Skeet: Towards a Lightweight Serverless Framework Supporting Modern AI-Driven App Development," was presented at ENASE 2024, an international software engineering conference held in Angers, France, on April 28-29, 2024. Dr. James represented the team and received high acclaim for his presentation.

This study proposes a lightweight serverless framework for modern AI-driven application development. The research was published in the conference proceedings and indexed in Google Scholar, Scopus, and other major databases, making it widely accessible to the research community.
