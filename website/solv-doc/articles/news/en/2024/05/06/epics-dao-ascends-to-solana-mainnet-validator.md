ELSOUL LABO B.V. (ELSOUL LABO, Headquarters: Amsterdam, Netherlands, CEO: Fumitake Kawasaki) and Epics DAO, established by the company to support open-source software development and operate a Web3 NFT card game, have jointly developed a unique open-source tool for Solana validators called "solv." They have operated this tool on the Solana testnet for about a year to promote innovation and sustainability within the Solana ecosystem.

Recently, Epics DAO has passed the rigorous screening process and strict performance standards (which require maintaining server operation in good condition for about a year) of the Solana Foundation's onboarding process. As a result, Epics DAO has officially ascended to a validator on the Solana mainnet.

In this new role, Epics DAO is committed to actively contributing to the stability and security of the Solana blockchain network. By leveraging our expertise and the open-source tool "solv" that we have developed, we aim to maximize the potential of decentralized technology and contribute to the further development of the Solana ecosystem.

Epics DAO believes in the power of open-source and blockchain technologies and is dedicated to building a fairer and more transparent digital future through these innovative technologies.

## About Epics DAO's Ascension to Solana Mainnet Validator

![Epics DAO Solana Mainnet Validator](/news/2024/05/06/EpicsSolanaMainnetValidator.jpg)

As we commence operations as a Solana mainnet validator, Epics DAO has ascended to a validator on the Solana mainnet after passing the rigorous screening process of the Solana Foundation through about a year of operations on the testnet.

The voting account for staking is "EpicsoqLdDP8qRn3wQRKTSKAXbjK9dUgFfNPRQS77MQD." Users with staking capabilities in wallets such as Phantom can search for "Epics" to select us, "Epics DAO," as their validator. We are currently offering a staking reward of 7.05% APR.

With your support, Epics DAO can drive further innovation within the Solana ecosystem and contribute to the community as a whole. We hope you will join us in our vision and growth through staking.

Epics DAO and ELSOUL LABO have jointly developed the open-source software "solv" to facilitate the easy setup and operation of Solana validators.

With the official start of Epics DAO's operations as a Solana mainnet validator, we will actively address challenges and improvements in managing multiple validators and evolve "solv" into an even more convenient tool.

We look forward to continuing our active engagement in the development of blockchain technology and open-source software, and we are honored to contribute to the development of the entire community.

We sincerely thank you for your continued support.

## Social Issues to be Solved by Epics DAO

In recent years, high-quality open-source software, which is predominantly free, has been adopted by 97% of companies, showing significant growth. However, as many projects are volunteer-driven, they often suffer from financial difficulties or a lack of resources, leading to inadequate maintenance. Consequently, over half of the software globally is at risk due to serious security vulnerabilities.

The Epics platform addresses this issue by providing appropriate incentives for development, funding, and PR - three crucial resources for projects. It promotes collaboration among community members with different roles, such as developers, investors, and marketing activists, with the aim of enhancing support for open-source software development, ensuring sustainable development, global software security, and further improving quality.

![Epics Platform](/news/2024/03/12/EpicsPlatformEN.jpg)

On the Epics platform, contributions to open-source result in earning card packs that can be used in the NFT card game "Buidlers Guild". As the type of cards received varies with the nature of the work (development, investment, or publicity), it fosters a supportive community where everyone aids in clearing tasks. Even users who do not play the card game find value in obtaining card packs due to demand from players, and valuable cards can lead to advantageous trades on the market, making it a platform enjoyable for all positions.

By focusing on fun and play on the platform, a sustainable open-source development environment is created, leading to high-quality open-source software that can address various social issues. This positive cycle is what Epics DAO strives to achieve.

We look forward to your participation. For more details, please check the official Discord.
