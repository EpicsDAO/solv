## BDLC NFT Staking for "No Loss Donation"

![Buidlers Collective No Loss Donation](/news/2024/05/13/NoLossDonationStakingMechanismEN.jpg)

When you stake BDLC NFTs on the Epics platform, you earn $EPCT token rewards, and the same amount of $EPCT is donated to the open-source project being staked for, helping fund future development. This initiative leverages blockchain to achieve socially impactful NFT staking and the concept of "No Loss Donation," which allows staking rewards to be donated without losing the principal amount.

The Buidlers Collective NFT was minted in June 2022 and is celebrating its 2nd anniversary this June. To commemorate this milestone, a snapshot and special gifts have been arranged, and an event is planned. Please check the official Discord server for more details.

## Social Issues to be Solved by Epics DAO

In recent years, high-quality open-source software, which is predominantly free, has been adopted by 97% of companies, showing significant growth. However, as many projects are volunteer-driven, they often suffer from financial difficulties or a lack of resources, leading to inadequate maintenance. Consequently, over half of the software globally is at risk due to serious security vulnerabilities.

The Epics platform addresses this issue by providing appropriate incentives for development, funding, and PR - three crucial resources for projects. It promotes collaboration among community members with different roles, such as developers, investors, and marketing activists, with the aim of enhancing support for open-source software development, ensuring sustainable development, global software security, and further improving quality.

![Epics Platform](/news/2024/03/12/EpicsPlatformEN.jpg)

On the Epics platform, contributions to open-source result in earning card packs that can be used in the NFT card game "Buidlers Guild". As the type of cards received varies with the nature of the work (development, investment, or publicity), it fosters a supportive community where everyone aids in clearing tasks. Even users who do not play the card game find value in obtaining card packs due to demand from players, and valuable cards can lead to advantageous trades on the market, making it a platform enjoyable for all positions.

By focusing on fun and play on the platform, a sustainable open-source development environment is created, leading to high-quality open-source software that can address various social issues. This positive cycle is what Epics DAO strives to achieve.

We look forward to your participation. For more details, please check the official Discord.
