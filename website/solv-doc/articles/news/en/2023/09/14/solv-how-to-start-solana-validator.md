## solv - The CLI Tool for Solana Validators

solv is an open-source CLI tool designed to simplify the setup and operation of Solana validators. With solv, you can easily handle validator setup, operation, monitoring, alerts, and upgrades.

Whether you are new to Solana validators or already active as one, you can easily transition to using solv and make your ongoing operations more efficient and hassle-free.

The main objectives of solv are as follows:

- **Promoting Decentralization of the Solana Network:** solv is designed to allow many users to easily participate in the Solana network, contributing to network decentralization and an inclusive technological society.
- **Reducing the Workload and Burden of Validator Operations:** Users of solv can easily perform many settings and updates with a single command. This allows Solana validators with a deep understanding of advanced technology to create more social value.
- **Strengthening Open-Source Community Resources:** solv aims to lower the barriers to entry for validators, enabling more open-source development communities to earn validator rewards and build a sustainable open-source development environment.

Using solv, three new Solana testnet validators have been launched. Originally developed to improve the operational efficiency of our development team and the entire community, this tool has been made open-source to spread its value to the Solana and broader open-source communities.
