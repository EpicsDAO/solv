description: Motivation for the development of "solv", Open-Source CLI Tool for Solana Validators
---

The Solana ecosystem is rapidly growing every day, and validators are at its core. Our teams at Epics DAO, ELSOUL LABO, and the open-source "Skeet" development community have all actively worked as Solana validators. Through this experience, we deeply understand the challenges and needs faced by Solana validators, leading to the development of "solv".

solv is an open-source CLI tool designed to simplify the setup and operation of Solana validators and RPC nodes. By using solv, you can easily manage validator and RPC node setup, operation, monitoring, alerts, upgrades, and other validator tasks.

solv makes it easy for new Solana validators, those setting up RPC nodes, and even those already operating as validators or managing RPC nodes to transition to using solv and subsequently manage their operations more effortlessly and smoothly.

The main aims of solv are as follows:

### Promoting the Decentralization of the Solana Network

Designed to allow more users to participate in the Solana network easily by simplifying update tasks, contributing to network decentralization and a technology innovation society that leaves no one behind. As an open-source tool, it offers transparency while building a safe and reliable validator network.

### Reducing the Hassle and Burden of Update Tasks

solv users can easily perform many settings and updates with just one command. Since the Solana network operates globally, update tasks do not always fall within reasonable working hours. Even if it's difficult to respond to updates on time due to time zone differences, you can set updates from the solv command and complete them automatically. This saves time for Solana validators with advanced skills, allowing them to create more social value.

### Strengthening the Resources of the Open Source Community

Technically adept open-source communities are encouraged to participate as validators. However, the barrier remains high as not all developers are familiar with specific blockchains. solv aims to lower this hurdle for participating as validators, enabling more open-source development communities to earn validator rewards and build a sustainable open-source development environment.

This tool was originally developed to improve operational efficiency for our development team and the wider community. However, believing it to be beneficial for Solana validators, the entire Solana community, and all open-source development communities, we have made solv available as an open-source tool, allowing all users to use it freely and at no cost.

We hope you will give it a try.
