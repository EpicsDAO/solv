## CLI Tool for Managing Solana Validators - "solv"

By using solv, setting up a Solana validator node server becomes much easier. This powerful tool simplifies blockchain operations and allows you to start a Solana validator with just a single command.

By eliminating the complexity of setting up and managing a validator, solv opens the door for more individuals to participate in the blockchain network, making the Solana ecosystem more accessible.

Whether you're an experienced developer or a blockchain enthusiast venturing into the world of validators, solv provides a solution for simple and fast setup.

Dive into the world of Solana, explore the capabilities of solv, and become a part of the blockchain revolution with minimal effort and maximum efficiency.

## Solana Validator Setup

When you run the `solv setup` command, a prompt like the following will appear.
Select the network, node type, and either RPC type or validator type.

Example: For an RPC node

Example: For a Validator

For the validator type, you can also set options like commission here.

Once the setup is complete, the snapshot download will automatically begin,
and your Solana validator will start üéä

If the snapshot download doesn't complete, press Ctrl + C to stop,
and then run the `solv restart --rm` command again.

Starting a new Solana validator can take anywhere from several minutes to several hours.
You can check the logs using the following command:

```bash
solv log
```

or

```bash
solv m
```

`m` is an alias for the `monitor` command.

‚Äª`solv monitor` does not work until the snapshot download is complete.
