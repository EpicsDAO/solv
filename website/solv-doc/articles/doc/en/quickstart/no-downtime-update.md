## Migrate Solv3 Instructions

![solv](https://storage.googleapis.com/epics-bucket/solv/assets/v3/solv3Released.jpg)

We updated the solv version to Ver.3 to support the latest requirements of Solana Official Docs.

⭐️ Improved

- Changed Mountpoint/Directory as the solana official docs
- Removed unnecessary swapfile and ramdisk made performance better
- Added solv s for solv Dashboard (no command maintenance)

Below is the migration guide for existing solv users.(Mainly TDS attendees)

```bash
$ solv update
```

Open solv Dashboard

```bash
$ solv s
```

Set your default Language for initial setup

```bash
Solv Version: v3.2.0

? Select Language (Use arrow keys)
❯ en
  ja
```

Open solv Dashboard again to reflect the language change

```bash
$ solv s
```
