## About RPC Nodes

In the world of digital assets, even a moment's delay can mean a significant opportunity loss. This chapter details a crucial step for traders & Web3 developers to secure a competitive edge in the market: how to build a private Solana RPC node.

We will delve into why a fast network connection is extremely important and the advantages of setting up a personal RPC node for this purpose. Additionally, to make it understandable even for those with limited technical knowledge, we guide you through the node-building process in three steps. From the best practices for security to choosing the optimal hardware and setting up the network, we cover all the necessary information.

## Hardware recommendations

Hardware recommendations use more RAM than regular validator nodes.

#### RAM

- 512GB or more

The recommended environment other than RAM is the same as the normal settings.

## üñ•Ô∏è Connect to server

Now let's install `solv` on the server.
First, connect to the server via SSH.
Please change your connection settings.

```bash
$ ssh username@<your-server-ip-address>
```

## üöÄ Step 1 - Install solv

Then copy and paste the code from step 1 from the solv documentation page and run it.

```bash
$ bash -c "$(curl -sSfL "https://storage.googleapis.com/epics-bucket/resource/solv/v4.5.0/install")"
```

This command first creates the solv user, so
Set a password.

After the installation is complete, you will be asked for a password to switch to the solv user.
Enter the password you set and switch users.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step 2 - Update settings

Next, run the code in step 2 to reflect the settings.

```bash
$ cd ~ && source ~/.profile
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Step 3 - solv setup

Finally, run the code in step 3 and you're done!

```bash
$ solv setup
```

This time select `RPC_NODE`.

Then

After startup, the snapshot download will start automatically.
The Solana validator will start üéä

It can take several hours to catch up with the latest slots.
If you cannot catch up, there may be a lack of specifications.

You can check the current status with the command below.

```bash
solv monitor
 00:30:58 | 28512 slots behind | Processed Slot: 244629395 | Confirmed Slot: 244629395 | Finalized
```

## Connection confirmation

Keep up with the latest slots
You can retrieve data from Solana's on-chain through nodes on your local computer.

Check Solana's network using the following command.

```bash
curl http://localhost:8899 -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
 "jsonrpc": "2.0",
 "id": 1,
 "method": "getBlockHeight"
}'
```

If you get a response like the one below, it's a success!

```
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":225529913,"id":1}
```

## When changing the validator startup script

The default value of `account-index` is

Contains `program-id`.

To change this option, edit the file directly and

Restart solv

`solv stop`

and

`solv start`

Please make sure to run it.
(\* The solv restart command overwrites the startup script.)

## üéâ Conclusion: Completing the Journey as a Solana Validator and an Invitation to the EpicsDAO Community

Through this book, we have provided a comprehensive guide for walking the path as a validator on the Solana network. We aimed to clearly explain all the steps from setting up to operating and updating a Solana validator, from beginners to advanced users, so that each reader could acquire the knowledge and tools necessary for success in this field.

Particularly important is the introduction of an open-source tool called 'solv'. This tool has significantly simplified the setup and operation of Solana validators, making the process quicker and more efficient. From secure secret key management to efficient node reconstruction, this book will be a solid support for you to thrive as a Solana validator.

The journey from Chapter 1 to Chapter 5 is not just about technical learning; it is a significant step towards forging the future of blockchain. With this book in hand, you become a part of the Solana network, capable of creating new value and contributing to the evolution of blockchain technology.

Now that you have completed this guide, we recommend joining the EpicsDAO Discord channel for further interaction and learning. Here, like-minded developers gather to share experiences and knowledge, supporting each other. Your step forward will carve a new chapter in the future of blockchain.
