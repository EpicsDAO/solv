Solv v4 introduces a new command that enables node migration without downtime.\n\nAs of August 2024, the `solv switch` command has been added to make the process even more user-friendly. The traditional `solv change` command has been replaced by `solv switch` and will be deprecated in the future.\n\nWith `solv change`, it was necessary to execute commands on both the source and destination nodes. However, with `solv switch`, node migration is completed by executing the command on only one node.\n\nThis no-downtime migration feature is important not only for routine updates but also for maintaining a high validator score and enhancing reliability. It contributes to the stability of the Solana network.\n\nFurthermore, in cases of validator node relocation, the ability to migrate without downtime ensures more stable validator operations, whether in strategic or emergency situations.\n\n# How to Use the Solv Switch Command\n\nThe `solv switch` command is essential for supporting no-downtime migration of validator nodes.  \nBefore executing this command, ensure that both the source and destination nodes are operating normally.\n\nThe `solv switch` command has two modes:\n\n- **Incoming**: Switch from the source node to the destination node\n- **Outgoing**: Switch from the destination node back to the source node\n\nBy using these modes appropriately, you can smoothly migrate nodes.\n\nThis document explains a typical Solana version upgrade procedure as an example:\n\n1. Execute the `solv switch` Incoming mode from the inactive node.\n2. Update Solana's version and restart.\n3. Execute the `Outgoing` mode from the now-active node to return to the original state.\n\nThe `solv switch` command can be utilized in various scenarios, such as switching between active and spare nodes,  \nmoving validator nodes, and updating Solana versions.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nEnsure that both the source and destination nodes are operating normally.  \nIn this explanation, the source node performing the voting is referred to as Active, and the destination node not yet performing the voting is referred to as Inactive.\n\nTo migrate using the `solv switch` command, the following conditions must be met:\n\n- The node must be a Solana validator node started with Solv v4 or later.\n- The node must be caught up with the latest block using `solv catchup`.\n- SSH connection must be possible from the source (Active) to the destination (Inactive) for Outgoing mode.\n- SSH connection must be possible from the destination (Inactive) to the source (Active) for Incoming mode.\n\nThe following describes the steps for when one node is already operational, and a second node is being newly launched.\n\n## Setting Up SSH Connection (Inactive Node)\n\nDownload the key from the Active node and set it up on the new node.\n\nFirst, configure the SSH key on the destination node.\n\n```bash\n$ solv scp init\nGenerating public/private rsa key pair.\nEnter file in which to save the key (/home/solv/.ssh/id_rsa):\nCreated directory '/home/solv/.ssh'.\nEnter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):\nEnter same passphrase again:\nYour identification has been saved in /home/solv/.ssh/id_rsa\nYour public key has been saved in /home/solv/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\n```\n\nThen display the SSH public key.\n\n```bash\n$ solv scp cat\n```\n\nCopy the displayed content.\n\n## Transferring the Key (Active Node)\n\nNext, connect to the Active node and add the SSH public key to the destination node.\n\n```bash\n$ solv scp create\n? Enter your SSH Public Key (xxxxxxxpubkeyxxxxxxxx)\n```\n\nPaste the public key you copied earlier.\n\n## Launching the New Node (Inactive Node)\n\nThen, connect to the destination node to download the key from the Active node and execute the following command.\n\n```bash\n$ solv scp download\n? Enter your Ubuntu Server IP x.x.x.x\n✔︎ Downloading mainnet-validator-keypair.json\n✔︎ Downloading mainnet-vote-account-keypair.json\n✔︎ Downloading mainnet-authority-keypair.json\n```\n\nNow, launch the new node at the destination.\n\n```bash\n$ solv setup\nSetting up Solana Validator ...\n? Which solv types do you want to setup? (Use arrow keys)\n  TESTNET_VALIDATOR\n❯ MAINNET_VALIDATOR\n  RPC_NODE\n```\n\nSelect the type of Solv.  \nThen, select the Solana client.\n\n```bash\n? Which mainnet mode do you want to setup?\n  SolanaClient\n❯ JitoMev\n  Firedancer\nJITO MEV Setup Mode on!\n? Do you want to setup as a dummy(Inactive) node?(※For Migration) (y/N)\n```\n\nYou will be asked interactively if this is a dummy node, select y.\n\n```bash\n? Enter commission bps 1000\n? Select region (Use arrow keys)\n❯ Amsterdam\n  Frankfurt\n  NewYork\n  Tokyo\n```\n\nSet the bps commission and region.\n\n```bash\n? Do you want to setup Relayer Also?(※This requires more than 512GB RAM) (y/N)\n```\n\nYou will be asked if you want to set up Jito Relayer. Select y if needed.  \nThis setup requires at least 512GB of RAM.\n\n```bash\n? What is your commission rate? You can change it later (default: 10%)\n```\n\nSet the commission rate.\n\nThis completes the launch of the new node.\n\nCheck the logs to ensure it is running properly.\n\n```bash\n$ solv log\n```\n\nWait for the new node to catch up to the latest block.\n\n```bash\n$ solv monitor\n```\n\nThis waiting time depends on the network situation but usually takes several hours.  \nIf your computer's specs are low or the network is unstable, it may not catch up.  \nIn such cases, recheck the network or specifications.\n\nYou can also redo the snapshot download with the following command.  \nIf the startup is not successful, redo the snapshot download.\n\n```bash\n$ solv restart --rm\n```\n\nProceed with the following steps.\n\n## Executing the Solv Switch Command (Inactive Node)\n\nExecute the Incoming mode of `solv switch`.\n\n```bash\n$ solv switch\n? Which switch type do you want to perform?※Mainnet Only (Use arrow keys)\n❯ Incoming\n  Outgoing\n? What is the IP address of the new validator? (1.1.1.1)\n```\n\nEnter the IP address of the Active node.\n\n![Incoming Mode](https://storage.googleapis.com/epics-bucket/solv/assets/switch/solv-switch-incoming.png)\n\nThe inactive node has successfully switched to the active node!\n\n## Updating Solana Version and Restart\n\nAfter switching with `solv switch`, if the Solana version of the node that switched from Active to Inactive is not the latest,  \nupdate the Solana version and restart with the following command.\n\n```bash\n$ solv update && solv update -b\n```\n\nThis updates the node's Solana version to the latest and restarts it.  \nTo manually update the version, execute the following command.\n\n```bash\n$ solv update --config\n$ solv i\n```\n\nThis command updates the Solana version to the latest but does not restart it.\n\nWait until the Slot is up to date.\n\n```bash\n$ solv catchup\n```\n\nOnce you have caught up to the latest Slot, return to the previous node and execute the `Outgoing` mode of `solv switch`.\n\n## Executing the Solv Switch Command (Active Node)\n\nExecute the Outgoing mode of `solv switch`.\n\n```bash\n$ solv switch\n? Which switch type do you want to perform?※Mainnet Only (Use arrow keys)\n  Incoming\n❯ Outgoing\n? What is the IP address of the new validator? (1.1.1.1)\n```\n\nEnter the IP address of the Inactive node.\n\n![Outgoing Mode](https://storage.googleapis.com/epics-bucket/solv/assets/switch/solv-switch-outgoing.png)\n\nThe active node has successfully switched to the inactive node!\n\nYou can now safely remove the spare server.\n\n## EpicsDAO Discord Channel\n\nIf you have any questions, please contact us on the EpicsDAO `solv` channel.\n\n[https://discord.gg/yxm5hJqRhg](https://discord.gg/yxm5hJqRhg)\n"},"articleHtml":"<p>Minimizing downtime for validator nodes is crucial for maintaining the stability of the Solana network.
