When I first became interested in becoming a Solana validator, the procedures were scattered, and it was a real challenge to determine which information was accurate.\n\nHowever, that challenge proved to be fruitful. Now, I have set up and am operating Solana Testnet validator servers in three different regions: Amsterdam, Tokyo, and New York. There are rewards for being a Solana testnet validator, and effective operation and regular maintenance are essential.\n\nFrom this experience, I developed scripts to streamline the update process. To give back to the community, I have open-sourced these as a package called Solv.\n\n'solv' is designed to allow anyone, even without technical knowledge, to easily set up a Solana validator node. In this guide, I will introduce three simple steps to build a validator node using solv. Our vision is to realize a truly decentralized network. To achieve this, it is crucial to provide an environment where everyone can participate, regardless of their technical background.\n\nIn this chapter, we assume the use of two computers: a `local computer` and a `validator server`.\n\nOn the local computer, we are using MacOS, but it is also possible to use Linux Ubuntu. For those using Windows, we recommend setting up an Ubuntu environment using WSL2.\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install\n\n## üíª Recommended Environment\n\nThe computer environment required for a Solana Validator is very demanding, even when compared to other blockchain platforms. These high system requirements are one of the secrets behind Solana's transaction processing capabilities. The Solana network is known for its speed, which is supported by powerful hardware and optimized settings.\n\nMinimum SOL Requirements\n\n| Requirement                                         | Value             |\n| --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |\n| Reserve for the voting account needed for consensus | 0.02685864 SOL    |\n| Cost of sending a vote transaction per block        | Up to 1.1 SOL/day |\n\n#### CPU\n\n- 12 cores/24 threads or more\n- 2.8GHz base clock speed or higher\n- Support for SHA extension instructions (AMD Gen 3 and later/Intel Ice Lake and later)\n\n#### RAM\n\n- 256GB or more\n- 512GB capacity motherboard recommended\n\n#### Disc\n\n- PCIe Gen3 x4 NVME SSD or later\n- Accounts: 500GB or more.

Select region (Use arrow keys)\n‚ùØ Amsterdam\n  Frankfurt\n  NewYork\n  Tokyo\n```\n\nSet the commission bps and region.\n\n```bash\n? Do you want to setup Relayer Also?(‚ÄªThis requires more than 512GB RAM) (y/N)\n```\n\nConfirm whether to set up Jito Relayer as needed. This setup requires at least 512GB of RAM.\n\n```bash\n? What is your commission rate? You can change it later (default: 10%)\n```\n\nSet the commission rate.\n\n```bash\n? Enter swap size to create in MB: (256000)\n```\n\nSet the swap size.\nWriting the swap may take some time.\n\nThis completes the setup.\n\n## üìú Checking Logs\n\nCheck the logs for Solana validators.\n\n```bash\n$ solv log\n```\n\nTo output abnormal logs, use:\n\n```bash\n$ solv log -e\n```\n\n## üñ•Ô∏è Monitor Command\n\nYou can check the current status of the validators with the following command.\n\n```bash\nsolv monitor\n```\n\n## ‚èπÔ∏è Stopping the Validator\n\nTo exchange the default created keys with existing ones, you need to stop the validator node once.\n\n```bash\nsolv stop\n```\n\nIn the next chapter, we will discuss how to exchange and update the keys.\n\n## üî¥ YouTube solv Hands-On Video\n\nYouTube: Easy Solana Validator Node Setup and Migration with Solv4 | Complete Guide to No-Downtime Migration üéâ\n\nhttps://youtu.be/t4KHXqguTi8?si=HI0YJ0pKB72s671t\n"},"articleHtml":"<p>In this chapter, we take the first steps towards success as a Solana validator.
