(Headquarters: Amsterdam, Netherlands, CEO: Fumitake Kawasaki) and Epics DAO, an organization established by ELSOUL LABO to support open-source software development and operate a Web3 NFT card game, are promoting innovation and sustainable development in blockchain technology through the development and operation of the open-source software \"solv\" for Solana blockchain validators. After 18 months of operation, its performance and reliability have been proven, and it is now widely used by many users on both the Solana mainnet and testnet.\n\nWe are pleased to announce the release of the new \"solv MEV Mode,\" which automates Solana validator operations and optimizes rewards.\n\n## Challenges in Solana Validator Operations\n\nAll activities on the Solana blockchain (Web3 applications, dApps, token transactions, etc.) are supported by validators worldwide. Currently, about 1,500 Solana mainnet validators are operational, many of which are managed by individuals.\n\nValidators are distributed globally and operate while balancing family and work responsibilities. Updates are required several times a week, but for validators in Japan, they often occur late at night, necessitating prompt action. Delays in updates can affect their trust score, resulting in penalties and impacting their rewards.\n\nFurthermore, validators need to manage voting and validation costs as well as rewards. The Solana blockchain operates on an epoch-based system, with evaluations and reward calculations occurring every epoch. However, since an epoch is not linked to a 24-hour cycle, regular management is challenging.\n\n## About the New \"solv MEV Mode\"\n\nThe new \"solv MEV Mode\" frees validators from daily SSH access to their nodes and enables automated reward maximization and compounding. The node's status is constantly monitored, and any anomalies are immediately notified via Discord, allowing validators to operate with peace of mind.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n- **Automatic Updates:** Solv MEV Mode automatically updates the Solana validator client and solv software version, ensuring the latest version is always running.\n- **Monitoring:** It monitors the health and balance of validators and sends notifications to Discord if any anomalies are detected.\n- **Automatic Reward Harvesting:** Rewards are harvested just before the end of an epoch to optimize returns.\n- **Automatic Staking:** Harvested rewards are converted to LST (Liquid Staking Token - elSOL) and sent to the specified account.\n- **Enhanced Security:** By keeping the SOL balance of the validator node low and converting rewards to LST, it mitigates the risk of large SOL withdrawals and maintains high returns.\n\nFor more details on solv MEV Mode and configuration instructions, please refer to the following documentation:\n\nhttps://solv.epics.dev/en/doc/quickstart/solv-mev-mode/\n\n※ MEV stands for Maximum Extractable Value, which refers to the pursuit of as much profit as possible.\n\n## What is elSOL?\n\n![elSOL](/news/2024/07/05/elSOLlst.jpg)\n\nelSOL is a tokenized representation (LST: Liquid Staking Token) of a staking account based on a high-quality validator pool managed by the solv development team. This pool is composed of multiple experienced and high-quality validators, ensuring high validator scores and stability by performing software updates with no downtime. These validators operate with a user fee of 0%, providing an efficient and cost-effective staking solution.\n\nelSOL - SOLscan: https://solscan.io/token/ELSoL1owwMWQ9foMsutweCsMKbTPVBD9pFqxQGidTaMC\n\nelSOL utilizes the official Solana Stake Pool program, increasing the value of the underlying staking accounts after each epoch, which in turn increases the amount of SOL each elSOL represents.\n\nSolana Stake Pool Program: https://spl.solana.com/stake-pool\n\n## Why elSOL?\n\nThe main advantage of elSOL is its composability. Tokenized staking accounts can be used by any program that operates on tokens. This allows elSOL to integrate with other Solana DeFi protocols like Jupiter, providing various financial services.\n\nJupiter: https://jup.ag/swap/SOL-ELSoL1owwMWQ9foMsutweCsMKbTPVBD9pFqxQGidTaMC\n\nelSOL is also listed in liquidity pools on Orca, where you can stake SOL into elSOL and supply it to liquidity pools to maximize your rewards.\n\nOrca elSOL Liquidity Pool (LP): https://www.orca.so/pools?tokens=ELSoL1owwMWQ9foMsutweCsMKbTPVBD9pFqxQGidTaMC\n\nBy holding elSOL, you can retain an asset that increases in value relative to SOL while using almost any Solana program. This opens up new opportunities to leverage staked assets.\n\n## Benefits of Holding elSOL\n\n1. **Ensured Immediate Liquidity:** With elSOL, you can ensure immediate liquidity without waiting for the end of an epoch. For example, if you need 5 SOL to purchase an NFT, you can instantly swap elSOL for SOL, while the remaining elSOL continues to earn rewards.\n2. **Automatic MEV Reward Collection and Compounding:** elSOL automatically collects MEV rewards and compounds them, increasing its value relative to SOL. This is more efficient than manually collecting and reinvesting MEV rewards.\n\nCurrently, elSOL can be staked easily with just one command using the solv CLI. An elSOL application will soon be released, allowing staking via UI.\n\n## ELSOUL LABO and Epics DAO\n\nELSOUL LABO and Epics DAO's core teams are actively involved in open-source software development.\n\nThey operate two open-source software projects, \"solv\" and \"Skeet.\"\n\n![solv](/news/2024/03/12/solvEN.jpg)\n\n\"solv\" is an open-source tool simplifying the setup and operation of Solana validators and RPC nodes.

However, as many projects are volunteer-driven, they often suffer from financial difficulties or a lack of resources, leading to inadequate maintenance. Consequently, over half of the software globally is at risk due to serious security vulnerabilities.\n\nThe Epics platform addresses this issue by providing appropriate incentives for development, funding, and PR - three crucial resources for projects. It promotes collaboration among community members with different roles, such as developers, investors, and marketing activists, with the aim of enhancing support for open-source software development, ensuring sustainable development, global software security, and further improving quality.\n\n![Epics Platform](/news/2024/03/12/EpicsPlatformEN.jpg)\n\nOn the Epics platform, contributions to open-source result in earning card packs that can be used in the NFT card game \"Buidlers Guild\". As the type of cards received varies with the nature of the work (development, investment, or publicity), it fosters a supportive community where everyone aids in clearing tasks. Even users who do not play the card game find value in obtaining card packs due to demand from players, and valuable cards can lead to advantageous trades on the market, making it a platform enjoyable for all positions.\n\nBy focusing on fun and play on the platform, a sustainable open-source development environment is created, leading to high-quality open-source software that can address various social issues. This positive cycle is what Epics DAO strives to achieve.\n\nWe look forward to your participation.

This tool has proven its performance and reliability over approximately one year of operation and is now extensively used by many users on both the mainnet and testnet of the Solana blockchain.\n\nSimilarly, the Skeet development team, also established by ELSOUL LABO, has been leveraging its software development expertise for validator operations, aiming to enhance the sustainability of open-source development by allocating rewards to cover necessary costs and utilizing 'solv' in operating Solana blockchain validators.\n\nWe are pleased to announce the establishment of the only Solana blockchain data center in India by the Skeet development team.\n\n## The Decision to Establish India’s Only Solana Data Center and the Inside Story of Skeet Development\n\n![Solana Mainnet Data Centers](/news/2024/05/16/SolanaMainnetDataCenters.jpg)\n\nCurrently, there are about 1,700 Solana mainnet validators operating worldwide, distributed across 317 mainnet data centers.\n\nReference: https://www.validators.app/data-centers?locale=en&network=mainnet&sort_by=data_center\n\nHowever, as of May 2024, there were no Solana data centers in India.\n\nLooking at the global distribution of Solana data centers, many are concentrated in the USA and Europe, while Asia, Oceania, South America, and Africa still have far fewer data centers.\n\nOne reason for this is server costs. Large data centers incur significant cooling costs. Additionally, the maintenance expenses of data centers are heavily influenced by the location's environmental conditions, making operations in regions with harsh climates like India difficult and costly.\n\nThese server costs directly impact validator operational profits, creating a barrier to entry. This trend is pronounced; the higher the server costs, the fewer the validators in that region.\n\nFurthermore, launching and maintaining validators is costly. Especially in regions with few validators, preparing the right machine specs and managing operations becomes more complex, and initial setups are particularly challenging.\n\nAt one point, the few Solana validators operating in India withdrew due to these high costs.\n\n![Solana Data Center Locations](/news/2024/05/16/SolanaDataCenterLocations.jpg)\n\nFor the Solana network, and indeed for the proliferation and development of blockchain technology, it's crucial to distribute data centers globally.\n\nUsers in regions without nearby validator nodes experience degraded network performance, which stifles development and results in lost opportunities for innovation.\n\nIn 2018, the founding members of ELSOUL LABO set up an offshore app development company in India, working on numerous projects alongside many Indian IT professionals.\n\nIndia boasts a vast number of IT technicians and numerous development projects.\n\nThe fluidity of developers, who typically move from project to project, is high. Therefore, Indian IT technicians are very proactive about new technologies and eager to learn.\n\nHowever, unifying team perceptions and development methods was challenging.\n\nWe relied heavily on open-source application frameworks to standardize development methods and deeply appreciated their value.\n\nHowever, organizations using application frameworks faced several challenges, especially in deployment.\n\nIssues that worked in the development environment but failed in production and errors due to differences in environment among team members degraded development efficiency. Ultimately, difficulty in unifying development led us to withdraw, which was regrettable.\n\nThis was not a flaw in the application frameworks themselves but an inherent difficulty in deploying applications.\n\nWe felt the need to integrate a robust (environmentally stable without unexpected errors) environment into the framework entirely, which led us to start researching serverless frameworks immediately after withdrawing.\n\nOur third open-source serverless framework, Skeet, was presented at the international conference ENASE 2024 and received high acclaim from many participants.\n\nTo give back to India, where we made this significant discovery, we decided to establish the only Solana data center in the country.\n\nThis will contribute to the proliferation and development of the Solana network in India, providing many Indian IT technicians with opportunities to tackle new innovations where we see significant potential and value.\n\nIn fact, when we began our business in India in 2018, QR payment systems like Paytm were already widespread, enabling transactions at street vendors and food stalls. PayPay, which has become commonplace in Japan today, was launched in October 2018 and developed based on Paytm's technology, showcasing the rapid pace of technological adoption and innovation in India.\n\nWe look forward to numerous blockchain-based innovations emerging in India in the future.\n\nSolana Mainnet Data Center (India, Mumbai): https://www.validators.app/data-centers/396982-IN-Mumbai?locale=en&network=mainnet\n\n![Skeet built India's First Solana Data Center](/news/2024/05/16/SkeetLaunchedFirstSolanaDataCenterInIndia.jpg)\n\nSkeet has set a 0% fee for users who stake SOL, with an annual percentage rate (APR) of rewards at 7.58%.\n\nTo facilitate the participation of subsequent validators in regions with very few Solana validators and to aim for high validator scores, we use high-spec machine resources of 112 vCPUs + 896 GB RAM and have established a robust operating system.\n\nEven if there is a problem with the hardware, we can quickly and easily relocate using the open-source 'solv'. The status of this new data center in Mumbai, India, is constantly monitored by ELSOUL LABO, ensuring rapid fixing in any emergency.\n\nWe would be very pleased if you continue to support our activities.\n\nSkeet - Solana Mainnet Validator: https://www.validators.app/validators/LionBN8UQ69Amea77CurDSCnRDVGTMND9oyv74ZteE2?locale=en&network=mainnet\n\n![Skeet Solana Mainnet Validator](/news/2024/05/16/SkeetSolanaMainnetValidator.jpg)\n\n## ELSOUL LABO and Epics DAO\n\nELSOUL LABO and Epics DAO's core teams are actively involved in open-source software development.\n\nThey operate two open-source software projects, \"solv\" and \"Skeet.\"\n\n![solv](/news/2024/03/12/solvEN.jpg)\n\n\"solv\" is an open-source tool simplifying the setup and operation of Solana validators and RPC nodes.

(headquartered in Amsterdam, Netherlands, CEO: Fumitake Kawasaki) and its Web3 project aimed at supporting open-source development, Epics DAO, which develops a socially-contributing NFT card game, have jointly released a new version, v3.3.0, of their open-source Solana validator tool, \"solv\".\n\nWith solv v3.3.0, we have adopted pnpm, enabling faster updates. Additionally, the complex 4-step task required for the validator restart process on the 21st (mandatory for all Solana validators) can now be easily completed with a single command.\n\n## Easier Maintenance and Faster Updates for Solana Validators\n\nsolv v3.3.0 introduces the use of pnpm for faster installation and updates. pnpm allows for installing and updating only the necessary parts, significantly reducing the time required for these processes. This efficient software installation also saves disk space.\n\nSolana validators frequently face software update opportunities. On the 21st, a complex 4-step validator restart process for testnet recovery was announced.\n\nReference - About the validator restart process on the 21st: https://github.com/bartenbach/cluster_restart/blob/master/README.md\n\nWith solv v3.3.0, this validator restart process can be easily completed with a single command. By leveraging the advantages of open-source, we can streamline the work of the entire validator community, creating more social value.\n\nFor those who have already implemented solv, please see the release notes for this update.\n\nsolv - v3.3.0 Release Notes: https://github.com/EpicsDAO/solv/releases/tag/%40epics-dao%2Fsolv%403.3.0\n\nThose considering implementing solv will find that starting and transitioning to its use is easier than expected. Currently compatible with both Solana's official client and JitoMEV's mainnets, with plans to support Firedancer. As an open-source tool, it is available for free. For more details, please see the official documentation.\n\nsolv Official Documentation: https://solv.epics.dev/en/\n\n## About the Solana Validator Tool 'solv'\n\n![Solana Validator Tool - solv](/news/2024/01/23/solv3en.jpg)\n\nsolv is an open-source CLI tool designed to simplify the setup and operation of Solana validators and RPC nodes. By using solv, you can easily manage validator and RPC node setup, operation, monitoring, alerts, upgrades, and other validator tasks.\n\nsolv makes it easy for new Solana validators, those setting up RPC nodes, and even those already operating as validators or managing RPC nodes to transition to using solv and subsequently manage their operations more effortlessly and smoothly.\n\nThe main aims of solv are as follows:\n\n### Promoting the Decentralization of the Solana Network\n\nDesigned to allow more users to participate in the Solana network easily by simplifying update tasks, contributing to network decentralization and a technology innovation society that leaves no one behind. As an open-source tool, it offers transparency while building a safe and reliable validator network.\n\n### Reducing the Hassle and Burden of Update Tasks\n\nsolv users can easily perform many settings and updates with just one command. Since the Solana network operates globally, update tasks do not always fall within reasonable working hours. Even if it's difficult to respond to updates on time due to time zone differences, you can set updates from the solv command and complete them automatically. This saves time for Solana validators with advanced skills, allowing them to create more social value.\n\n### Strengthening the Resources of the Open-Source Community\n\nTechnically adept open-source communities are encouraged to participate as validators.

(headquartered in Amsterdam, Netherlands) has announced the release of \"solv\", an open-source CLI tool developed by its initiative, Epics DAO. This tool simplifies the setup and operation of validators on the Solana blockchain.\n\nThe Solana ecosystem is rapidly growing every day, and validators are at its core. Our teams at Epics DAO, ELSOUL LABO, and the open-source \"Skeet\" development community have all actively worked as Solana validators. Through this experience, we deeply understand the challenges and needs faced by Solana validators, leading to the development of \"solv\".\n\nsolv (GitHub): https://github.com/EpicsDAO/solv\n\n## solv - The CLI Tool for Solana Validators\n\n![solv is the utility tool for Solana Validators](/news/2023/08/17/solvCLI.png)\n\nsolv is an open-source CLI tool designed to simplify the setup, operation, monitoring, alerting, and upgrading tasks for Solana validators. With solv, whether you're new to the role of a Solana validator or already active, you can transition to using solv and smoothly carry out your operations with less hassle.\n\nThe main objectives of solv include:\n\n- **Promoting the Decentralization of the Solana Network:** By simplifying validator operations, solv is designed to make it easier for a broader range of users to participate in the Solana network. This contributes to a more decentralized network and a more inclusive technological society. With its open-source nature, it promotes a transparent, secure, and highly reliable validator network.\n- **Reducing the Hassles and Burdens of Validator Operations:** Users of solv can easily conduct many settings and updates with a single command. Given that the Solana network operates globally, validator operations don't just fit into regular business hours. Even when early updates are challenging due to time zone differences, updates can be set and automatically completed via solv commands. By saving the time of Solana validators with advanced technical skills, these validators can create even greater societal value.\n- **Strengthening Open-Source Community Resources:** Technically knowledgeable open-source communities are encouraged to participate as validators. However, not all developers are familiar with a specific blockchain, so there remains a substantial barrier to entry. solv aims to lower this barrier, enabling more open-source developers to earn rewards as validators and promote a sustainable open-source development environment.\n\nOriginally, this tool was developed to increase our development team and the entire community's operational efficiency. However, we believe it holds significant value for the entire Solana validator and Solana community, as well as all open-source development communities. Therefore, we've made solv open-source and freely available for all users. We encourage everyone to give it a try.\n\nFor more details, please visit the following GitHub repository:\n\nsolv (GitHub): https://github.com/EpicsDAO/solv\n"}],"title":"News | solv - An Open-Source Tool for Easily Setting Up and Effortlessly Managing Solana Validators and RPC Nodes","seoData":[{"property":"og:title","content":"News | solv - An Open-Source Tool for Easily Setting Up and Effortlessly Managing Solana Validators and RPC Nodes"},{"name":"twitter:title","content":"News | solv - An Open-Source Tool for Easily Setting Up and Effortlessly Managing Solana Validators and RPC Nodes"},{"name":"twitter:text:title","content":"News | solv - An Open-Source Tool for Easily Setting Up and Effortlessly Managing Solana Validators and RPC Nodes"},{"name":"description","content":"News"},{"property":"og:description","content":"News"},{"name":"twitter:description","content":"News"},{"property":"og:url","content":"https://solv.epics.dev/en/news"},{"property":"og:image","content":"https://solv.epics.dev/ogp.png"},{"property":"og:image:secure","content":"https://solv.epics.dev/ogp.png"},{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://solv.epics.dev/ogp.png"}],"_nextI18Next":{"initialI18nStore":{"en":{"common":{"contactToTeam":"Talk with Team","privacy":"Privacy","404title":"Page not found","404body":"Sorry, we couldn't find the page you're looking for.","backToTop":"Back to top page","toc":"Table of Contents","openMenu":"Open menu","closeMenu":"Close menu","media":"Media","news":"News","books":"Books","copy":"Copy","copied":"Copied!","solvInstall":"Install solv","updateSettings":"Update settings","setupSolv":"Setup","thatsAll":"That's all!","navs":{"defaultMainNav":{"quickstart":"Quickstart","news":"News","doc":"Docs","dao":"DAO","enterprise":"Enterprise","contact":"Contact"},"commonFooterNav":{"quickstart":"Quickstart","news":"News","doc":"Docs","enterprise":"Enterprise","dao":"DAO","contact":"Contact","privacy":"Privacy","press-kits":"Press Kits"}},"AgreeToPolicy":{"title":"Your Choices Regarding Cookies","body":"We and our third party partners use cookies and similar technologies to process certain information, such as your IP address and digital identifiers, to analyze site usage and provide you better experiences.
