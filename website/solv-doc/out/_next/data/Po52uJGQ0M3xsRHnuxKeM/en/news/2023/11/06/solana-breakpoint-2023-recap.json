(Headquarters: Amsterdam, Netherlands, CEO: Fumitake Kawasaki) and Epics DAO, an organization established by ELSOUL LABO to support open-source software development and operate a Web3 NFT card game, are promoting innovation and sustainable development in blockchain technology through the development and operation of the open-source software \"solv\" for Solana blockchain validators. After 18 months of operation, its performance and reliability have been proven, and it is now widely used by many users on both the Solana mainnet and testnet.\n\nWe are pleased to announce the release of the new \"solv MEV Mode,\" which automates Solana validator operations and optimizes rewards.\n\n## Challenges in Solana Validator Operations\n\nAll activities on the Solana blockchain (Web3 applications, dApps, token transactions, etc.) are supported by validators worldwide. Currently, about 1,500 Solana mainnet validators are operational, many of which are managed by individuals.\n\nValidators are distributed globally and operate while balancing family and work responsibilities. Updates are required several times a week, but for validators in Japan, they often occur late at night, necessitating prompt action. Delays in updates can affect their trust score, resulting in penalties and impacting their rewards.\n\nFurthermore, validators need to manage voting and validation costs as well as rewards. The Solana blockchain operates on an epoch-based system, with evaluations and reward calculations occurring every epoch. However, since an epoch is not linked to a 24-hour cycle, regular management is challenging.\n\n## About the New \"solv MEV Mode\"\n\nThe new \"solv MEV Mode\" frees validators from daily SSH access to their nodes and enables automated reward maximization and compounding. The node's status is constantly monitored, and any anomalies are immediately notified via Discord, allowing validators to operate with peace of mind.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n- **Automatic Updates:** Solv MEV Mode automatically updates the Solana validator client and solv software version, ensuring the latest version is always running.\n- **Monitoring:** It monitors the health and balance of validators and sends notifications to Discord if any anomalies are detected.\n- **Automatic Reward Harvesting:** Rewards are harvested just before the end of an epoch to optimize returns.\n- **Automatic Staking:** Harvested rewards are converted to LST (Liquid Staking Token - elSOL) and sent to the specified account.\n- **Enhanced Security:** By keeping the SOL balance of the validator node low and converting rewards to LST, it mitigates the risk of large SOL withdrawals and maintains high returns.\n\nFor more details on solv MEV Mode and configuration instructions, please refer to the following documentation:\n\nhttps://solv.epics.dev/en/doc/quickstart/solv-mev-mode/\n\n※ MEV stands for Maximum Extractable Value, which refers to the pursuit of as much profit as possible.\n\n## What is elSOL?\n\n![elSOL](/news/2024/07/05/elSOLlst.jpg)\n\nelSOL is a tokenized representation (LST: Liquid Staking Token) of a staking account based on a high-quality validator pool managed by the solv development team. This pool is composed of multiple experienced and high-quality validators, ensuring high validator scores and stability by performing software updates with no downtime. These validators operate with a user fee of 0%, providing an efficient and cost-effective staking solution.\n\nelSOL - SOLscan: https://solscan.io/token/ELSoL1owwMWQ9foMsutweCsMKbTPVBD9pFqxQGidTaMC\n\nelSOL utilizes the official Solana Stake Pool program, increasing the value of the underlying staking accounts after each epoch, which in turn increases the amount of SOL each elSOL represents.\n\nSolana Stake Pool Program: https://spl.solana.com/stake-pool\n\n## Why elSOL?\n\nThe main advantage of elSOL is its composability. Tokenized staking accounts can be used by any program that operates on tokens. This allows elSOL to integrate with other Solana DeFi protocols like Jupiter, providing various financial services.\n\nJupiter: https://jup.ag/swap/SOL-ELSoL1owwMWQ9foMsutweCsMKbTPVBD9pFqxQGidTaMC\n\nelSOL is also listed in liquidity pools on Orca, where you can stake SOL into elSOL and supply it to liquidity pools to maximize your rewards.\n\nOrca elSOL Liquidity Pool (LP): https://www.orca.so/pools?tokens=ELSoL1owwMWQ9foMsutweCsMKbTPVBD9pFqxQGidTaMC\n\nBy holding elSOL, you can retain an asset that increases in value relative to SOL while using almost any Solana program. This opens up new opportunities to leverage staked assets.\n\n## Benefits of Holding elSOL\n\n1. **Ensured Immediate Liquidity:** With elSOL, you can ensure immediate liquidity without waiting for the end of an epoch. For example, if you need 5 SOL to purchase an NFT, you can instantly swap elSOL for SOL, while the remaining elSOL continues to earn rewards.\n2. **Automatic MEV Reward Collection and Compounding:** elSOL automatically collects MEV rewards and compounds them, increasing its value relative to SOL. This is more efficient than manually collecting and reinvesting MEV rewards.\n\nCurrently, elSOL can be staked easily with just one command using the solv CLI. An elSOL application will soon be released, allowing staking via UI.\n\n## ELSOUL LABO and Epics DAO\n\nELSOUL LABO and Epics DAO's core teams are actively involved in open-source software development.\n\nThey operate two open-source software projects, \"solv\" and \"Skeet.\"\n\n![solv](/news/2024/03/12/solvEN.jpg)\n\n\"solv\" is an open-source tool simplifying the setup and operation of Solana validators and RPC nodes.

However, as many projects are volunteer-driven, they often suffer from financial difficulties or a lack of resources, leading to inadequate maintenance. Consequently, over half of the software globally is at risk due to serious security vulnerabilities.\n\nThe Epics platform addresses this issue by providing appropriate incentives for development, funding, and PR - three crucial resources for projects. It promotes collaboration among community members with different roles, such as developers, investors, and marketing activists, with the aim of enhancing support for open-source software development, ensuring sustainable development, global software security, and further improving quality.\n\n![Epics Platform](/news/2024/03/12/EpicsPlatformEN.jpg)\n\nOn the Epics platform, contributions to open-source result in earning card packs that can be used in the NFT card game \"Buidlers Guild\". As the type of cards received varies with the nature of the work (development, investment, or publicity), it fosters a supportive community where everyone aids in clearing tasks. Even users who do not play the card game find value in obtaining card packs due to demand from players, and valuable cards can lead to advantageous trades on the market, making it a platform enjoyable for all positions.\n\nBy focusing on fun and play on the platform, a sustainable open-source development environment is created, leading to high-quality open-source software that can address various social issues. This positive cycle is what Epics DAO strives to achieve.\n\nWe look forward to your participation.
