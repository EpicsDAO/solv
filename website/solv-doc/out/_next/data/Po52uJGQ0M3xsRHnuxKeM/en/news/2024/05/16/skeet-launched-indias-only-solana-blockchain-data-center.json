(Headquarters: Amsterdam, Netherlands, CEO: Fumitake Kawasaki) and Epics DAO, an organization established by ELSOUL LABO to support open-source software development and operate a Web3 NFT card game, are promoting innovation and sustainable development in blockchain technology through the development and operation of the open-source software \"solv\" for Solana blockchain validators. After 18 months of operation, its performance and reliability have been proven, and it is now widely used by many users on both the Solana mainnet and testnet.\n\nWe are pleased to announce the release of the new \"solv MEV Mode,\" which automates Solana validator operations and optimizes rewards.\n\n## Challenges in Solana Validator Operations\n\nAll activities on the Solana blockchain (Web3 applications, dApps, token transactions, etc.) are supported by validators worldwide. Currently, about 1,500 Solana mainnet validators are operational, many of which are managed by individuals.\n\nValidators are distributed globally and operate while balancing family and work responsibilities. Updates are required several times a week, but for validators in Japan, they often occur late at night, necessitating prompt action. Delays in updates can affect their trust score, resulting in penalties and impacting their rewards.\n\nFurthermore, validators need to manage voting and validation costs as well as rewards. The Solana blockchain operates on an epoch-based system, with evaluations and reward calculations occurring every epoch. However, since an epoch is not linked to a 24-hour cycle, regular management is challenging.\n\n## About the New \"solv MEV Mode\"\n\nThe new \"solv MEV Mode\" frees validators from daily SSH access to their nodes and enables automated reward maximization and compounding. The node's status is constantly monitored, and any anomalies are immediately notified via Discord, allowing validators to operate with peace of mind.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n- **Automatic Updates:** Solv MEV Mode automatically updates the Solana validator client and solv software version, ensuring the latest version is always running.\n- **Monitoring:** It monitors the health and balance of validators and sends notifications to Discord if any anomalies are detected.\n- **Automatic Reward Harvesting:** Rewards are harvested just before the end of an epoch to optimize returns.\n- **Automatic Staking:** Harvested rewards are converted to LST (Liquid Staking Token - elSOL) and sent to the specified account.\n- **Enhanced Security:** By keeping the SOL balance of the validator node low and converting rewards to LST, it mitigates the risk of large SOL withdrawals and maintains high returns.\n\nFor more details on solv MEV Mode and configuration instructions, please refer to the following documentation:\n\nhttps://solv.epics.dev/en/doc/quickstart/solv-mev-mode/\n\n※ MEV stands for Maximum Extractable Value, which refers to the pursuit of as much profit as possible.\n\n## What is elSOL?\n\n![elSOL](/news/2024/07/05/elSOLlst.jpg)\n\nelSOL is a tokenized representation (LST: Liquid Staking Token) of a staking account based on a high-quality validator pool managed by the solv development team. This pool is composed of multiple experienced and high-quality validators, ensuring high validator scores and stability by performing software updates with no downtime. These validators operate with a user fee of 0%, providing an efficient and cost-effective staking solution.\n\nelSOL - SOLscan: https://solscan.io/token/ELSoL1owwMWQ9foMsutweCsMKbTPVBD9pFqxQGidTaMC\n\nelSOL utilizes the official Solana Stake Pool program, increasing the value of the underlying staking accounts after each epoch, which in turn increases the amount of SOL each elSOL represents.\n\nSolana Stake Pool Program: https://spl.solana.com/stake-pool\n\n## Why elSOL?\n\nThe main advantage of elSOL is its composability. Tokenized staking accounts can be used by any program that operates on tokens. This allows elSOL to integrate with other Solana DeFi protocols like Jupiter, providing various financial services.\n\nJupiter: https://jup.ag/swap/SOL-ELSoL1owwMWQ9foMsutweCsMKbTPVBD9pFqxQGidTaMC\n\nelSOL is also listed in liquidity pools on Orca, where you can stake SOL into elSOL and supply it to liquidity pools to maximize your rewards.\n\nOrca elSOL Liquidity Pool (LP): https://www.orca.so/pools?tokens=ELSoL1owwMWQ9foMsutweCsMKbTPVBD9pFqxQGidTaMC\n\nBy holding elSOL, you can retain an asset that increases in value relative to SOL while using almost any Solana program. This opens up new opportunities to leverage staked assets.\n\n## Benefits of Holding elSOL\n\n1. **Ensured Immediate Liquidity:** With elSOL, you can ensure immediate liquidity without waiting for the end of an epoch. For example, if you need 5 SOL to purchase an NFT, you can instantly swap elSOL for SOL, while the remaining elSOL continues to earn rewards.\n2. **Automatic MEV Reward Collection and Compounding:** elSOL automatically collects MEV rewards and compounds them, increasing its value relative to SOL. This is more efficient than manually collecting and reinvesting MEV rewards.\n\nCurrently, elSOL can be staked easily with just one command using the solv CLI. An elSOL application will soon be released, allowing staking via UI.\n\n## ELSOUL LABO and Epics DAO\n\nELSOUL LABO and Epics DAO's core teams are actively involved in open-source software development.\n\nThey operate two open-source software projects, \"solv\" and \"Skeet.\"\n\n![solv](/news/2024/03/12/solvEN.jpg)\n\n\"solv\" is an open-source tool simplifying the setup and operation of Solana validators and RPC nodes.

(Headquarters: Amsterdam, Netherlands, CEO: Fumitake Kawasaki), together with Epics DAO, which it established to operate a Web3 NFT card game supporting open-source software development, is driving innovation and sustainable development in blockchain technology through the development and operation of 'solv', an open-source tool for Solana blockchain validators. This tool has proven its performance and reliability over approximately one year of operation and is now extensively used by many users on both the mainnet and testnet of the Solana blockchain.\n\nSimilarly, the Skeet development team, also established by ELSOUL LABO, has been leveraging its software development expertise for validator operations, aiming to enhance the sustainability of open-source development by allocating rewards to cover necessary costs and utilizing 'solv' in operating Solana blockchain validators.\n\nWe are pleased to announce the establishment of the only Solana blockchain data center in India by the Skeet development team.\n\n## The Decision to Establish India’s Only Solana Data Center and the Inside Story of Skeet Development\n\n![Solana Mainnet Data Centers](/news/2024/05/16/SolanaMainnetDataCenters.jpg)\n\nCurrently, there are about 1,700 Solana mainnet validators operating worldwide, distributed across 317 mainnet data centers.\n\nReference: https://www.validators.app/data-centers?locale=en&network=mainnet&sort_by=data_center\n\nHowever, as of May 2024, there were no Solana data centers in India.\n\nLooking at the global distribution of Solana data centers, many are concentrated in the USA and Europe, while Asia, Oceania, South America, and Africa still have far fewer data centers.\n\nOne reason for this is server costs. Large data centers incur significant cooling costs. Additionally, the maintenance expenses of data centers are heavily influenced by the location's environmental conditions, making operations in regions with harsh climates like India difficult and costly.\n\nThese server costs directly impact validator operational profits, creating a barrier to entry. This trend is pronounced; the higher the server costs, the fewer the validators in that region.\n\nFurthermore, launching and maintaining validators is costly. Especially in regions with few validators, preparing the right machine specs and managing operations becomes more complex, and initial setups are particularly challenging.\n\nAt one point, the few Solana validators operating in India withdrew due to these high costs.\n\n![Solana Data Center Locations](/news/2024/05/16/SolanaDataCenterLocations.jpg)\n\nFor the Solana network, and indeed for the proliferation and development of blockchain technology, it's crucial to distribute data centers globally.\n\nUsers in regions without nearby validator nodes experience degraded network performance, which stifles development and results in lost opportunities for innovation.\n\nIn 2018, the founding members of ELSOUL LABO set up an offshore app development company in India, working on numerous projects alongside many Indian IT professionals.\n\nIndia boasts a vast number of IT technicians and numerous development projects.\n\nThe fluidity of developers, who typically move from project to project, is high. Therefore, Indian IT technicians are very proactive about new technologies and eager to learn.\n\nHowever, unifying team perceptions and development methods was challenging.\n\nWe relied heavily on open-source application frameworks to standardize development methods and deeply appreciated their value.\n\nHowever, organizations using application frameworks faced several challenges, especially in deployment.\n\nIssues that worked in the development environment but failed in production and errors due to differences in environment among team members degraded development efficiency. Ultimately, difficulty in unifying development led us to withdraw, which was regrettable.\n\nThis was not a flaw in the application frameworks themselves but an inherent difficulty in deploying applications.\n\nWe felt the need to integrate a robust (environmentally stable without unexpected errors) environment into the framework entirely, which led us to start researching serverless frameworks immediately after withdrawing.\n\nOur third open-source serverless framework, Skeet, was presented at the international conference ENASE 2024 and received high acclaim from many participants.\n\nTo give back to India, where we made this significant discovery, we decided to establish the only Solana data center in the country.\n\nThis will contribute to the proliferation and development of the Solana network in India, providing many Indian IT technicians with opportunities to tackle new innovations where we see significant potential and value.\n\nIn fact, when we began our business in India in 2018, QR payment systems like Paytm were already widespread, enabling transactions at street vendors and food stalls. PayPay, which has become commonplace in Japan today, was launched in October 2018 and developed based on Paytm's technology, showcasing the rapid pace of technological adoption and innovation in India.\n\nWe look forward to numerous blockchain-based innovations emerging in India in the future.\n\nSolana Mainnet Data Center (India, Mumbai): https://www.validators.app/data-centers/396982-IN-Mumbai?locale=en&network=mainnet\n\n![Skeet built India's First Solana Data Center](/news/2024/05/16/SkeetLaunchedFirstSolanaDataCenterInIndia.jpg)\n\nSkeet has set a 0% fee for users who stake SOL, with an annual percentage rate (APR) of rewards at 7.58%.\n\nTo facilitate the participation of subsequent validators in regions with very few Solana validators and to aim for high validator scores, we use high-spec machine resources of 112 vCPUs + 896 GB RAM and have established a robust operating system.\n\nEven if there is a problem with the hardware, we can quickly and easily relocate using the open-source 'solv'. The status of this new data center in Mumbai, India, is constantly monitored by ELSOUL LABO, ensuring rapid fixing in any emergency.\n\nWe would be very pleased if you continue to support our activities.\n\nSkeet - Solana Mainnet Validator: https://www.validators.app/validators/LionBN8UQ69Amea77CurDSCnRDVGTMND9oyv74ZteE2?locale=en&network=mainnet\n\n![Skeet Solana Mainnet Validator](/news/2024/05/16/SkeetSolanaMainnetValidator.jpg)\n\n## ELSOUL LABO and Epics DAO\n\nELSOUL LABO and Epics DAO's core teams are actively involved in open-source software development.\n\nThey operate two open-source software projects, \"solv\" and \"Skeet.\"\n\n![solv](/news/2024/03/12/solvEN.jpg)\n\n\"solv\" is an open-source tool simplifying the setup and operation of Solana validators and RPC nodes.

(Headquarters: Amsterdam, Netherlands, CEO: Fumitake Kawasaki), together with Epics DAO, which it established to operate a Web3 NFT card game supporting open-source software development, is driving innovation and sustainable development in blockchain technology through the development and operation of 'solv', an open-source tool for Solana blockchain validators. This tool has proven its performance and reliability over approximately one year of operation and is now extensively used by many users on both the mainnet and testnet of the Solana blockchain.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the Skeet development team, also established by ELSOUL LABO, has been leveraging its software development expertise for validator operations, aiming to enhance the sustainability of open-source development by allocating rewards to cover necessary costs and utilizing 'solv' in operating Solana blockchain validators.</p>\n<p>We are pleased to announce the establishment of the only Solana blockchain data center in India by the Skeet development team.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-decision-to-establish-indias-only-solana-data-center-and-the-inside-story-of-skeet-development\" class=\"font-extrabold tracking-tighter break-word\">The Decision to Establish India’s Only Solana Data Center and the Inside Story of Skeet Development</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/news/2024/05/16/SolanaMainnetDataCenters.jpg\" alt=\"Solana Mainnet Data Centers\"></p>\n<p>Currently, there are about 1,700 Solana mainnet validators operating worldwide, distributed across 317 mainnet data centers.</p>\n<p>Reference: <a href=\"https://www.validators.app/data-centers?locale=en&#x26;network=mainnet&#x26;sort_by=data_center\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.validators.app/data-centers?locale=en&#x26;network=mainnet&#x26;sort_by=data_center</a></p>\n<p>However, as of May 2024, there were no Solana data centers in India.</p>\n<p>Looking at the global distribution of Solana data centers, many are concentrated in the USA and Europe, while Asia, Oceania, South America, and Africa still have far fewer data centers.</p>\n<p>One reason for this is server costs. Large data centers incur significant cooling costs. Additionally, the maintenance expenses of data centers are heavily influenced by the location's environmental conditions, making operations in regions with harsh climates like India difficult and costly.</p>\n<p>These server costs directly impact validator operational profits, creating a barrier to entry. This trend is pronounced; the higher the server costs, the fewer the validators in that region.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, launching and maintaining validators is costly. Especially in regions with few validators, preparing the right machine specs and managing operations becomes more complex, and initial setups are particularly challenging.</p>\n<p>At one point, the few Solana validators operating in India withdrew due to these high costs.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/news/2024/05/16/SolanaDataCenterLocations.jpg\" alt=\"Solana Data Center Locations\"></p>\n<p>For the Solana network, and indeed for the proliferation and development of blockchain technology, it's crucial to distribute data centers globally.</p>\n<p>Users in regions without nearby validator nodes experience degraded network performance, which stifles development and results in lost opportunities for innovation.</p>\n<p>In 2018, the founding members of ELSOUL LABO set up an offshore app development company in India, working on numerous projects alongside many Indian IT professionals.</p>\n<p>India boasts a vast number of IT technicians and numerous development projects.</p>\n<p>The fluidity of developers, who typically move from project to project, is high. Therefore, Indian IT technicians are very proactive about new technologies and eager to learn.</p>\n<p>However, unifying team perceptions and development methods was challenging.</p>\n<p>We relied heavily on open-source application frameworks to standardize development methods and deeply appreciated their value.</p>\n<p>However, organizations using application frameworks faced several challenges, especially in deployment.</p>\n<p>Issues that worked in the development environment but failed in production and errors due to differences in environment among team members degraded development efficiency. Ultimately, difficulty in unifying development led us to withdraw, which was regrettable.</p>\n<p>This was not a flaw in the application frameworks themselves but an inherent difficulty in deploying applications.</p>\n<p>We felt the need to integrate a robust (environmentally stable without unexpected errors) environment into the framework entirely, which led us to start researching serverless frameworks immediately after withdrawing.</p>\n<p>Our third open-source serverless framework, Skeet, was presented at the international conference ENASE 2024 and received high acclaim from many participants.</p>\n<p>To give back to India, where we made this significant discovery, we decided to establish the only Solana data center in the country.</p>\n<p>This will contribute to the proliferation and development of the Solana network in India, providing many Indian IT technicians with opportunities to tackle new innovations where we see significant potential and value.</p>\n<p>In fact, when we began our business in India in 2018, QR payment systems like Paytm were already widespread, enabling transactions at street vendors and food stalls. PayPay, which has become commonplace in Japan today, was launched in October 2018 and developed based on Paytm's technology, showcasing the rapid pace of technological adoption and innovation in India.</p>\n<p>We look forward to numerous blockchain-based innovations emerging in India in the future.</p>\n<p>Solana Mainnet Data Center (India, Mumbai): <a href=\"https://www.validators.app/data-centers/396982-IN-Mumbai?locale=en&#x26;network=mainnet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.validators.app/data-centers/396982-IN-Mumbai?locale=en&#x26;network=mainnet</a></p>\n<p><img src=\"/news/2024/05/16/SkeetLaunchedFirstSolanaDataCenterInIndia.jpg\" alt=\"Skeet built India&#x27;s First Solana Data Center\"></p>\n<p>Skeet has set a 0% fee for users who stake SOL, with an annual percentage rate (APR) of rewards at 7.58%.</p>\n<p>To facilitate the participation of subsequent validators in regions with very few Solana validators and to aim for high validator scores, we use high-spec machine resources of 112 vCPUs + 896 GB RAM and have established a robust operating system.</p>\n<p>Even if there is a problem with the hardware, we can quickly and easily relocate using the open-source 'solv'. The status of this new data center in Mumbai, India, is constantly monitored by ELSOUL LABO, ensuring rapid fixing in any emergency.</p>\n<p>We would be very pleased if you continue to support our activities.</p>\n<p>Skeet - Solana Mainnet Validator: <a href=\"https://www.validators.app/validators/LionBN8UQ69Amea77CurDSCnRDVGTMND9oyv74ZteE2?locale=en&#x26;network=mainnet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.validators.app/validators/LionBN8UQ69Amea77CurDSCnRDVGTMND9oyv74ZteE2?locale=en&#x26;network=mainnet</a></p>\n<p><img src=\"/news/2024/05/16/SkeetSolanaMainnetValidator.jpg\" alt=\"Skeet Solana Mainnet Validator\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"elsoul-labo-and-epics-dao\" class=\"font-extrabold tracking-tighter break-word\">ELSOUL LABO and Epics DAO</h2>\n<p>ELSOUL LABO and Epics DAO's core teams are actively involved in open-source software development.</p>\n<p>They operate two open-source software projects, \"solv\" and \"Skeet.\"</p>\n<p><img src=\"/news/2024/03/12/solvEN.jpg\" alt=\"solv\"></p>\n<p>\"solv\" is an open-source tool simplifying the setup and operation of Solana validators and RPC nodes.
