Enter your SSH Public Key (xxxxxxxpubkeyxxxxxxxx)\n```\n\nNow paste the SSH public key you copied above.\nThe connection settings between the local computer and the validator node are now complete.\n\n## 🔀 Key Exchange (Local Computer → Validator Node)\n\nNext, execute the `solv` command from your local computer.\n\nPlease install `solv` at your local computer if you haven't already.\n\n```bash\n$ pnpm add -g @epics-dao/solv\n```\n\n### PNPM Installation\n\n```bash\n$ curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -\n```\n\n## Key Upload (Local Computer → Validator Node)\n\nExecute the following command to upload the keys.\n\n```bash\n$ solv scp upload\n```\n\nand enter the IP of the validator node displayed above.\n\n`~/solvKeys/upload`\n\nThe keys created in all chapters are\n\n`/home/solv/`\n\nwill be uploaded to the directory.\n(\\*If a file with the same name exists, it will be overwritten, so we recommend that you make a backup.)\n\n## 📦 Key Backup (Validator Node → Local Computer)\n\nIn this step, we will introduce how to back up keys from the `validator node` to your `local computer`.\nThe following four keys located in the `/home/solv` directory will be downloaded:\n\nRun the following command:\n\n```bash\n$ solv scp download\n?
