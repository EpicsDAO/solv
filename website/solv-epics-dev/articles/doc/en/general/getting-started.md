## CLI Tool for Managing Solana Validators - "solv"

By using solv, setting up a Solana validator node server becomes much easier. This powerful tool simplifies blockchain operations and allows you to start a Solana validator with just a single command.

By eliminating the complexity of setting up and managing a validator, solv opens the door for more individuals to participate in the blockchain network, making the Solana ecosystem more accessible.

Whether you're an experienced developer or a blockchain enthusiast venturing into the world of validators, solv provides a solution for simple and fast setup.

Dive into the world of Solana, explore the capabilities of solv, and become a part of the blockchain revolution with minimal effort and maximum efficiency.

## ðŸ“– Server Spec

- Linux Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Linux Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- Linux Ubuntu 24.04 LTS

## Solana Validator Setup

```bash
$ bash -c "$(curl -sSfL "https://solv-storage.validators.solutions/install")"
$ cd ~ && source ~/.profile
$ solv setup
```

When you run the `solv setup` command, a prompt like the following will appear.
Select the network, node type, and either RPC type or validator type.

Example: For an RPC node

Example: For a Validator

For the validator type, you can also set options like commission here.

Once the setup is complete, the snapshot download will automatically begin,
and your Solana validator will start ðŸŽŠ

If the snapshot download doesn't complete, press Ctrl + C to stop,
and then run the `solv restart --rm` command again.

Starting a new Solana validator can take anywhere from several minutes to several hours.
You can check the logs using the following command:

```bash
solv log
```

or

```bash
solv m
```

`m` is an alias for the `monitor` command.

â€»`solv monitor` does not work until the snapshot download is complete.
