## CLI Tool for Managing Solana Validators - "solv"

## ðŸ“– Server Spec

- Linux Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Linux Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- Linux Ubuntu 24.04 LTS

## Solana Validator Setup

Setup node:
```bash
nvm ls-remote
nvm install v22.12.0 # latest LTS
node --version
v22.12.0
```

Setup pnpm (ensure up-to-date):
```bash
brew upgrade pnpm
pnpm --version
9.15.0
```

Setup project:
```bash
pnpm install
```

When you run the `solv setup` command, a prompt like the following will appear.
Select the network, node type, and either RPC type or validator type.

Example: For an RPC node

Example: For a Validator

For the validator type, you can also set options like commission here.

Once the setup is complete, the snapshot download will automatically begin,
and your Solana validator will start ðŸŽŠ

If the snapshot download doesn't complete, press Ctrl + C to stop,
and then run the `solv restart --rm` command again.

Starting a new Solana validator can take anywhere from several minutes to several hours.
You can check the logs using the following command:

```bash
solv log
```

or

```bash
solv m
```

`m` is an alias for the `monitor` command.

â€»`solv monitor` does not work until the snapshot download is complete.
