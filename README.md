## Start Solana Validator

```bash
$ solv start
```

## Stop Solana Validator

```bash
$ solv stop
```

## Restart Solana Validator

```bash
$ solv restart
```

Default `solana-validator.sh` command is `--no-incremental-snapshots`.

If you want to download snapshot, you can use the following command.

```bash
$ solv restart --snapshot
```

This command will automatically remove `--no-incremental-snapshots` and add `--no-genesis-fetch`, `--no-snapshot-fetch` to yoursolana-validator.sh command.

## Solana Validator Status

```bash
$ solv status
```

## Solana Validator Logs

```bash
$ solv log
```

## Show Solana Validator Config

This command will show your all config paths which are used by solana validator.

```bash
$ solv get config
```

## Migrate Solv3 Instructions

We updated the solv version to v3.0.0 to support the latest requirements of Solana Official Docs.

‚≠êÔ∏è Improved

- Changed Mountpoint/Directory as the solana official docs
- Removed unnecessary swapfile and ramdisk
- Added solv s for solv Dashboard (no command maintenance)

Below is the migration guide for existing solv users.(Mainly TDS attendees)

```bash
$ solv update
```

Open solv Dashboard

```bash
$ solv s
```

Set your default Language for initial setup

```bash
Solv Version: v3.0.0

‚ùØ en
  ja
```

Open solv Dashboard again to reflect the language change

```bash
$ solv s
```

[![solv-s](https://storage.googleapis.com/epics-bucket/Validator/solv-s.jpeg)](https://storage.googleapis.com/epics-bucket/Validator/solv-s.jpeg)
