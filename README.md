## CLI Tool for Managing Solana Validators - "solv"

The utility tool for Solana Validators

solv is an open-source tool designed to simplify the setup and operation of Solana validators and RPC nodes.

Documentation: [https://solv.epics.dev/](https://solv.epics.dev/)

## ðŸ“– Server Spec

- Linux Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Linux Ubuntu 22.04 LTS

## Solana Validator Setup

Login in to your Validator server by ssh and run the following command.

```bash
$ bash -c "$(curl -sSfL "https://storage.googleapis.com/epics-bucket/resource/solv/v4.1.16/install")"
$ cd ~ && source ~/.profile
$ solv setup
```

Then, select the type of node you want to target.

- `TESTNET_VALIDATOR`
- `MAINNET_VALIDATOR`
- `RPC_NODE`

Then

After startup, the snapshot download will start automatically.
The Solana validator will start ðŸŽŠ

If your node does not start, you can try the following command.

```bash
$ solv restart --rm
```

This will remove the snapshot and restart the Solana Validator from the new snapshot.
If snapshot download freezes, you can try Ctrl + C.
Then setup will continue.

## New Feature: solv MEV Mode - v4.3.0~

ðŸŒ± No more SSH login required for Solana/solv version update ðŸŒ±

Introducing the new solv MEV mode that takes care of Solana/solv version updates seamlessly. Now, you can update the Solana/solv version without the need for SSH login to the server.

Key Features:

- Automated Updates: solv MEV mode will automatically update the Solana/solv version for you, ensuring you are always running the latest version without manual intervention.

- Monitoring: solv MEV mode will monitor the health status of your validator and balance, sending notifications to Discord.

- Automated Reward Harvesting: This mode will harvest your rewards to your authority account right before the epoch ends, optimizing your yield.

- Automated Staking: After harvesting, rewards will be converted from SOL to LST(Liquid Staking Token - elSOL) and sent to your desired account.

- Enhanced Security: By keeping the balance of SOL in your validator node low and converting rewards to LST, this strategy mitigates the risk of large-scale SOL withdrawals, ensuring high yield maintenance.

## What is solv MEV Mode?

solv MEV Mode is a feature designed to automate the maintenance of your Solana validator by regularly checking and updating the Solana/solv status and version.

## How it works

- solv epochTimer: This function will be set as a cron job to automatically monitor the health status of your validator and perform updates as needed.

- Automatic Restarts: If necessary, solv epochTimer will restart the validator to ensure optimal performance.

## solv epochTimer Monitors:

epochTimer will monitor the following aspects of your validator:

### Check Validator Account Balance

- Send a notification if the balance is less than 0.5 SOL.

### Check Validator Health Status

- Send a notification if the validator is not voting or is delinquent.

### Check Solana/solv Version Update

- Send a notification if the Solana/solv version is not up-to-date.
- Update the Solana/solv version automatically.
- Restart validator if it is required.
- Send a notification after the Solana/solv version update.

### Auto Harvest (Mainnet Only)

- Withdraw the rewards from vote account to the authority account.
- Calculate the balance needed for the next epoch.
- Transfer the balance from the validator account to the authority account.
- Convert SOL to LST(Liquid Staking Token) and send it to the harvest account.

By implementing solv MEV mode, you can maintain high security, ensure optimal performance, and enjoy the convenience of automated updates and reward management.

## How to use solv mev mode?

Run the following command:

```bash
$ solv mev
? Do you want to enable solv MEV Mode?(You can change it again) (y/N)
? Do you want to enable AUTO UPDATE? (Recommended) (y/N)
? Do you want to enable AUTO RESTART? (Recommended) (y/N)
â€» Please turn off if you are using no-downtime migration.
? Enter your Discord Webhook URL (https://discord.com/api/webhooks/1234)
```

1.  Enable solv MEV Mode.
2.  Enable AUTO UPDATE.
3.  Enable AUTO RESTART.

â€» Please turn off if you are using no-downtime migration.

â€» No-downtime migration requires spare server and manual restart.

4.  Enter your Discord Webhook URL.

â€» You can receive notifications about the Solana/solv version update.

5.  Enter RPC URL (Mainnet Only)
6.  Enter Harvest Account (Mainnet Only)

â€» Please DO NOT keep harvest account in the validator node.

## How to disable solv mev mode?

Run the following command:

```bash
$ solv mev
? Do you want to enable solv MEV Mode?(You can change it again) (y/N) n
âœ… Cron Job successfully removed.
```

## Run solv Server CLI - from your validator server

```bash
$ solv s
```
