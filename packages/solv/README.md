## CLI Tool for Managing Solana Validators - "solv"

The utility tool for Solana Validators

solv is an open-source tool designed to simplify the setup and operation of Solana validators and RPC nodes.

## üìñ Server Spec

- Linux Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Linux Ubuntu 22.04 LTS

## Solana Validator Setup

Login in to your Validator server by ssh and run the following command.

```bash
$ bash -c "$(curl -sSfL "https://storage.googleapis.com/epics-bucket/resource/solv/v4.1.2/install")"
$ cd ~ && source ~/.profile
$ solv setup
```

Then, select the type of node you want to target.

- `TESTNET_VALIDATOR`
- `MAINNET_VALIDATOR`
- `RPC_NODE`

Then

After startup, the snapshot download will start automatically.
The Solana validator will start üéä

If your node does not start, you can try the following command.

```bash
$ solv stop
$ solv rm:snapshot
$ solv get snapshot
$ solv start
```

This will remove the snapshot and restart the Solana Validator from the new snapshot.

## New Features - v4.0.0~v4.1.0

- Jito Relayer Setup
- Jito RPC Setup
- No Downtime Migration
- Snapshot Download Speed Improved 100x~ Faster

### Snapshot Download Speed Improved 100x~ Faster

solv integrated with solana snapshot finders for Solana Mainnet and Testnet.
This will improve the snapshot download speed 100x~ faster than before.
Greatly reduce the time to start the Solana Validator.

### No Downtime Migration

solv supports no downtime migration for Solana Validator.
You can migrate your Solana Validator to other servers without restarting the Solana Validator.

`solv change` command will help you to migrate your Solana Validator to other servers.

Prepare your new server(Inactive) and current server(Active) with the latest slot.
Then run the following command on new server(Inactive) and current server(Active).

‚Äª Please make sure to backup your keys before running the command.
‚Äª Please make sure to run the new server with solv4 as a dummy mode.

Run the following command on the current server(Active).
You will be asked to enter the new server IP address.

```bash
$ solv change
```

Then, you should quickly run the following command on the new server(Inactive).

```bash
$ solv change
```

This function was created with reference to the following link.
