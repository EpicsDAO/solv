## CLI Tool for Managing Solana Validators - "solv"

The utility tool for Solana Validators

solv is an open-source tool designed to simplify the setup and operation of Solana validators and RPC nodes.

## üìñ Server Spec

- Linux Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Linux Ubuntu 22.04 LTS

## Solana Validator Setup

Login in to your Validator server by ssh and run the following command.

```bash
$ bash -c "$(curl -sSfL "https://storage.googleapis.com/epics-bucket/resource/solv/v4.5.0/install")"
$ cd ~ && source ~/.profile
$ solv setup
```

Then, select the type of node you want to target.

- `TESTNET_VALIDATOR`
- `MAINNET_VALIDATOR`
- `RPC_NODE`

Then

After startup, the snapshot download will start automatically.
The Solana validator will start üéä

If your node does not start, you can try the following command.

This will remove the snapshot and restart the Solana Validator from the new snapshot.

```bash
$ solv restart --rm
```

equivalent to

```bash
$ solv stop
$ solv rm:snapshot
$ solv get snapshot
$ solv start
```

## solv MEV Mode

This will enable solv MEV Mode on your validator instance.
MEV Mode will allow you to harvest your rewards to your authority account every right before the epoch ends.
Then convert SOL to elSOL (LST) and send it to your desired account.

```bash
$ solv mev
? Do you want to enable solv MEV Mode? (y/N) y
? Enter your RPC URL (https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com)
? Enter your Harvest Address (your solana address)
? Enter your Discord Webhook URL (https://discord.com/api/webhooks/11111111/xxxxxxxx)
```

## New Feature: solv switch - v4.4.5~

`solv switch` command is better version of `solv change`.

```bash
$ solv switch
? Which switch type do you want to perform?‚ÄªMainnet Only (Use arrow keys)
‚ùØ Incoming
  Outgoing
? What is the IP address of the new validator? (1.1.1.1)
```

`solv change` required to connect both servers.
Now you only need to connect one server with `solv switch`

This command has 2 types

You choose the type of switch you want to perform.
Then put IP address of anothor side of server.

- Incoming
  Run at Active Server. Active Validator Identity switches from this server to a remote server.

- Outgoing
  Run at Inactive Server. Active Validator Identity switches to this server from a remote server.

This command executes migration commands on both servers.

## Run solv Server CLI - from your validator server

```bash
$ solv s
```

## Solana Validator Logs

```bash
$ solv log
```

or

Show only error logs

```bash
$ solv log -e
```

## Show Solana Validator Config

This command will show your all config paths which are used by solana validator.

```bash
$ solv config
```
