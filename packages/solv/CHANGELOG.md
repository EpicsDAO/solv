  Mainly We updated `solv setup` command!

  Now it's more user-friendly and easy to use. Easy to switch between different validators and RPC nodes.

  Since solana clients is updated, we also updated solv to be compatible with the latest solana clients.

  ## Update Install Script URL

  ```
  $ bash -c "$(curl -sSfL "https://solv-storage.validators.solutions/install")"
  ```

  ## This update includes Solana version update for mainnet-beta and testnet.

  To update your default solana version, run the following command:

  ```bash
  $ solv update && solv update --config
  ```

  To install the latest solana version, run the following command:

  ```bash
  $ solv i
  ```

  If you want to install a specific version, run the following command:

  ```bash
  $ solv i -v <version>
  ```

  To reflect the changes, restart the solana validator:

  ```bash
  $ solv restart
  ```

  ## What is solv MEV Mode?

  solv MEV Mode is a feature that automatically checks/updates the Solana/solv status/version for you.
  solv epochTimer will be set to cron job and will automatically check the validator's health status and update the Solana/solv version.
  It will also send notifications to your Discord channel.

  solv epochTimer checks following items:

  - Check Validator Account Balance
    Send a notification if the balance is less than 0.5 SOL.
  - Check Validator Health Status
    Send a notification if the validator is not voting or is delinquent.
  - Check Solana/solv Version Update
    Send a notification if the Solana/solv version is not up-to-date.
    Update the Solana/solv version automatically.
    Restart validator if it is required.
    Send a notification after the Solana/solv version update.
  - Auto Harvest (Mainnet Only)
    Withdraw the rewards from vote account to the authority account.
    Calculate the balance needed for the next epoch.
    Transfer the balance from the validator account to the vote account.
    Convert SOL to LST(Liquid Staking Token) and send it to the harvest account.

## 4.2.10

### Patch Changes

- [#225](https://github.com/EpicsDAO/solv/pull/225) [`5b00ad8`](https://github.com/EpicsDAO/solv/commit/5b00ad89270b5077f66508a169b6e08228600c44) Thanks [@POPPIN-FUMI](https://github.com/POPPIN-FUMI)! - update solv setup for cpu governor/sysctl.conf

  ## Update - solv setup for cpu governor/sysctl.conf

  ### CPU Governor

  The CPU governor is a driver that manages how the CPU scales frequency and voltage. The CPU governor can be set to performance, powersave, ondemand, conservative, schedutil, and userspace.
  solv setup will set the CPU governor to performance.

  - performance: The CPU runs at the maximum frequency.
  - powersave: The CPU runs at the minimum frequency.
  - ondemand: The CPU runs at the maximum frequency when the system is busy and at the minimum frequency when the system is idle.
  - conservative: The CPU runs at the maximum frequency when the system is busy and at the minimum frequency when the system is idle. It is more aggressive than ondemand.
  - schedutil: The CPU runs at the maximum frequency when the system is busy and at the minimum frequency when the system is idle. It is more aggressive than ondemand.

  If you are already running node,
  you can set the CPU governor to performance by running the following command.

  ```bash
  echo "performance" | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor
  ```

  Then, delete the existing ledger and snapshot files and restart the node.

  ```bash
  $ solv restart --rm
  ```

  ### Socket buffer sizes and TCP congestion control

  Depends on the kernel version, the sysctl.conf settings can be different.
  solv setup will set the following sysctl.conf settings if it's not set.

  ```bash
  # set default and maximum socket buffer sizes to 128MB
  net.core.rmem_default=134217728
  net.core.wmem_default=134217728
  net.core.rmem_max=134217728
  net.core.wmem_max=134217728

  # set minimum, default, and maximum tcp buffer sizes (10k, 87.38k (linux default), 128MB resp)
  net.ipv4.ttcp_rmem=10240 87380 134217728
  net.ipv4.tcp_wmem=10240 87380 134217728

  # Enable TCP westwood for kernels greater than or equal to 2.6.13
  net.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control=westwood
  ```

## 4.2.8

### Patch Changes

- [#221](https://github.com/EpicsDAO/solv/pull/221) [`17bf2a5`](https://github.com/EpicsDAO/solv/commit/17bf2a5ec10f44a77db77e956e97782d155c60d9) Thanks [@POPPIN-FUMI](https://github.com/POPPIN-FUMI)! - ## Update - epochTimer/solv restart

  ### Epoch Timer

  Epoch Timer will be set in cron job to check the epoch timer every 5 minutes.
  (※ You need solv mev to enable MEV mode)

  ```bash
  $ solv mev
  ? Do you want to enable solv MEV Mode? (y/N) y
  ? Enter your RPC URL (https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com)
  ? Enter your Harvest Address (your solana address)
  ? Enter your Discord Webhook URL (https://discord.com/api/webhooks/11111111/xxxxxxxx)
  ```

  This will enable solv MEV Mode on your validator instance.
  MEV Mode will allow you to harvest your rewards to your authority account every right before the epoch ends.
  Then convert SOL to elSOL (LST) and send it to your desired account.

  ### Epoch Timer Sends Discord Notification

  Epoch Timer will send a Discord notification when the epoch is less than 1 day, 8 hours, 1 hour and the new epoch starts.

  - New Epoch
  - Less than 1 day
  - Less than 8 hours
  - Less than 1 hours
    solv harvest will be executed automatically if solv MEV Mode is enabled.

  Besides, the epoch timer checks the Validator Account Balance and sends a notification when the balance is less than 0.5 SOL.

  ### solv Harvest

  solv harvest will be executed automatically if solv MEV Mode is enabled.
  This will harvest your rewards to your authority account every right before the epoch ends.
  Then convert SOL to elSOL (LST) and send it to your desired account.

  1. Withdraw rewards from the Vote Account to the Validator Authority Account.
  2. Calculate the amount of SOL to be transferred from the Validator Account to the Authority Account.
  3. Convert the amount of SOL to elSOL (LST).
  4. Transfer the elSOL (LST) to the desired account.

  This strategy keeps the balance of SOL in your validator node low, enhancing security by mitigating the risk of large-scale SOL withdrawals. By immediately converting earned rewards to LST, it ensures high yield maintenance.

  ## solv restart --rm option

  This will remove the snapshot and restart the Solana Validator from the new snapshot.

  ```bash
  $ solv restart --rm
  ```

  equivalent to

  ```bash
  $ solv stop
  $ solv rm:snapshot
  $ solv get snapshot
  $ solv start
  ```

  - Added Solana Liquid Staking Command
  - Added Solana Transfer Command
  - Added Auto Reward Harvest Command
  - Added Epoch Timer
  - Improved setup command
  - Improved log command
  - Added solv df command
  - Migrated to ESM Module
  - Added Turbo Repo

  * You should set the SOLANA_RPC_URL in the .env file to use this feature effectively.

  ### Solana Liquid Staking Command

  ```bash
  $ solv stake --lst
  ```

  ### Solana Transfer Command

  ```bash
  $ solv transfer/tr
  ```

  ### Auto Reward Harvest Command

  This command collects all rewards into the authority account, converts the gathered SOL to elSOL, and then transfers the elSOL to an external harvest account.

  This ensures that, in the event of a node hack, assets are not held within the node. Additionally, it allows immediate staking of rewards, thereby enhancing performance.

  ※ To use this command, you must first set the harvest account in the solv.config.json file. During the initial execution, you can input this information interactively.

  Please ensure that this account information is never stored on the validator server.

  ```bash
  $ solv harvest/hv
  ```

  Soon, we will be adding the ability to run the harvest command by the epochTimer.

  ### Epoch Timer

  The epochTimer is a feature that allows you to set a specific time to run the some commands.
  This feature is especially useful for those who want to stake rewards at before the epoch change.

  - You need to set `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` in the `.env` file to use this feature.

  ```bash
  $ solv epochTimer
  ```

  ### Improved setup command

  The setup command has been improved to allow you to set up without mounting the volume.

  ```bash
  $ solv setup
  ```

  ### Improved log command

  small bug fixes and improvements

  ```bash
  $ solv log
  ```

  ### Added solv df command

  This command shows the disk usage of the validator server.

  ```bash
  $ solv df
  ```

  ### Migrated to ESM Module

  solv has been migrated to ESM Module.

  ### Added Turbo Repo

  We have added a Turbo Repo to manage the solv package.

  ### Snapshot Download Speed Improved 100x~ Faster

  solv integrated with solana snapshot finders for Solana Mainnet and Testnet.
  This will improve the snapshot download speed 100x~ faster than before.
  Greatly reduce the time to start the Solana Validator.

  Special Thanks to c29r3 for the great OSS ⭐️

  - [Solana Snapshot Finder](https://github.com/c29r3/solana-snapshot-finder)

  If your node does not start, you can try the following command.

  ```bash
  $ solv stop
  $ solv rm:snapshot
  $ solv get snapshot
  $ solv start
  ```

  ### No Downtime Migration

  solv supports no downtime migration for Solana Validator.
  You can migrate your Solana Validator to other servers without restarting the Solana Validator.

  `solv change` command will help you to migrate your Solana Validator to other servers.

  Prepare your new server(Inactive) and current server(Active) with the latest slot.
  Then run the following command on new server(Inactive) and current server(Active).

  ※ Please make sure to backup your keys before running the command.
  ※ Please make sure to run the new server with solv4 as a dummy mode.
  ※ Please make sure running the current server with solv4 as NOT a dummy mode.

  Run the following command on the current server(Active).
  You will be asked to enter the new server IP address.

  ```bash
  $ solv change
  ```

  Then, you should quickly run the following command on the new server(Inactive).

  ```bash
  $ solv change
  ```

  This function was created with reference to the following link.

  - Compatible with Google Cloud (※You need to setup firewall and disk settings yourself)
  - New solv CLI Commands

  ## How to Update

  ```bash
  $ solv update
  ```

  ## No Downtime Migration

  Now you can migrate your validator without downtime.
  You need to setup your new server with solv4.
  (solv4 uses symbolic link to define the validator keypair path.)

  1. Setup your new server with solv4 as Dummy Server (Inactive Side)
     Please upload your main keys to the new server before setup.

  - mainnet-validator-keypair.json
  - mainnet-vote-account-keypair.json
  - mainnet-authority-keypair.json

  Please create SSH connection between your old server and new server.

  Create SSH Public Key.

  ```bash
  $ solv scp init
  ```

  Create SSH Connection.

  ```bash
  $ solv scp create
  ```

  Upload your keys to the new server.

  ```bash
  $ solv scp upload
  ```

  Download your keys from the old server.

  ```bash
  $ solv scp download
  ```

  2. Setup your new server with solv4 as Active Side

  ```bash
  $ solv setup
  ```

  Then, Please select Dummy Mode.

  Once the new server is ready, you can run `solv change` command to switch the server on Active Side to make it Inactive.

  ```bash
  $ solv change
  ```

  Then, immidiately run `solv change` command on the new server to switch the server on Active Side.

  ```bash
  $ solv change
  ```

  ※ This is for mainnet only.

  Added solv setup --swap to create `/swapfile` and enable swap on the system.
  This command will check if the current system has enough memory to create a swap file.
  If the system has enough memory, it will skip creating the swap file.
  If not, it will create a swap file and enable swap on the system.

  ```bash
  $ solv update
  $ solv -V
  3.3.14
  $ solv setup --swap
  ```

  Please check `/etc/fstab` to make sure the `/swapfile` is enabled on boot.
  Usually, no need to do anything as the default setup will enable the swap file on boot.

  ```bash
  cat /etc/fstab
  # /etc/fstab: static file system information.
  #
  # Use 'blkid' to print the universally unique identifier for a
  # device; this may be used with UUID= as a more robust way to name devices
  # that works even if disks are added and removed. See fstab(5).
