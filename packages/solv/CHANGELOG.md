## 3.3.14

### Patch Changes

- [#118](https://github.com/EpicsDAO/solv/pull/118) [`46694f9`](https://github.com/EpicsDAO/solv/commit/46694f9c02a34a5ded45af6a1f64005e7798b846) Thanks [@POPPIN-FUMI](https://github.com/POPPIN-FUMI)! - Add - solv setup --swap

  â€» This is for mainnet only.

  Added solv setup --swap to create `/swapfile` and enable swap on the system.
  This command will check if the current system has enough memory to create a swap file.
  If the system has enough memory, it will skip creating the swap file.
  If not, it will create a swap file and enable swap on the system.

  ```bash
  $ solv update
  $ solv -V
  3.3.14
  $ solv setup --swap
  ```

  Please check `/etc/fstab` to make sure the `/swapfile` is enabled on boot.
  Usually, no need to do anything as the default setup will enable the swap file on boot.

  ```bash
  cat /etc/fstab
  # /etc/fstab: static file system information.
  #
  # Use 'blkid' to print the universally unique identifier for a
  # device; this may be used with UUID= as a more robust way to name devices
  # that works even if disks are added and removed. See fstab(5).
