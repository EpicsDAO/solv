Now that we have the v2 version of the solv cli, we need to update the solv cli versioin.
So, we are adding a new function `getSolanaCLI` to get the solana cli version for agave/solana.
Also, solv switch incoming for v1 to v2.

Add - getSolanaCLI to get the solana cli version for agave/solana
Add - solv switch incoming for v1 to v2

solana version: 1.x.x will be deprecated soon, so we need to switch to v2.
