```

### No Downtime Migration

solv supports no downtime migration for Solana Validator.
You can migrate your Solana Validator to other servers without restarting the Solana Validator.

`solv change` command will help you to migrate your Solana Validator to other servers.

Prepare your new server(Inactive) and current server(Active) with the latest slot.
Then run the following command on new server(Inactive) and current server(Active).

‚Äª Please make sure to backup your keys before running the command.
‚Äª Please make sure to run the new server with solv4 as a dummy mode.
‚Äª Please make sure running the current server with solv4 as NOT a dummy mode.

Run the following command on the current server(Active).
You will be asked to enter the new server IP address.

```bash
$ solv change
```

Then, you should quickly run the following command on the new server(Inactive).

```bash
$ solv change
```
