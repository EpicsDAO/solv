Please create SSH connection between your old server and new server.

```bash
$ solv scp create
```

Upload your keys to the new server.

```bash
$ solv scp upload
```

Download your keys from the old server.

```bash
$ solv scp download
```

2. Setup your new server with solv4 as Active Side

```bash
$ solv setup
```

Then, Please select Dummy Mode.

Once the new server is ready, you can run `solv change` command to switch the server on Active Side to make it Inactive.
